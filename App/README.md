# draftt mobile app

This folder contains the react-native code for the front-end. The project has been setup using `expo-cli` and will be ejected once the front-end is complete.

---

This section highlights the steps to get a local instance of the front-end app running from the master branch.

## Getting Started
- Clone repository and navigate to `draftt/App`

## Requirements

- Npm (and Node)
  - See https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm for installation instructions

- Expo command line tools
  - run `npm install` in the `App/` directory to install `expo-cli` and all other dependencies needed by the project

- Install the Expo app on your phone

## Running the app

We use the `expo-cli` to run the application.

To launch the App on your phone:  

1. Run ``` npm start ``` in the `App/` directory
    - This will use the `expo-cli` to startup a server on your machine -- a browser tab will open displaying the console for the running App and a QR code. NOTE: if a new browser tab does not open, the QR code and console log should still show up in the terminal.
2. Scan the QR Code from within the Expo app on your phone
